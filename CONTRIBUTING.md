# Contributing to Exoplanet Detection using AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our NASA Space Apps Challenge project! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the exoplanet detection system.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git for version control
- Jupyter Notebook environment
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and astronomy

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Exoplanet-detection-using-AI.git
cd Exoplanet-detection-using-AI
```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install Development Dependencies**
```bash
pip install pytest black flake8 sphinx
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 guidelines with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **String quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Organize imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports

### Code Formatting

Use Black for code formatting:
```bash
black src/ notebooks/
```

### Linting

Run flake8 for code linting:
```bash
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=88
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic
- **Notebooks**: Include markdown cells explaining each section

## üìù Contributing Process

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Look at open issues in the GitHub repository
- Comment on the issue you'd like to work on
- Wait for assignment before starting work

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Follow the code style guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure notebooks run without errors

### 4. Testing

#### Unit Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

#### Notebook Testing
Ensure all notebooks can run from start to finish:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook notebooks/*.ipynb
```

### 5. Commit Changes

Use conventional commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with data loading"
git commit -m "docs: update README"
```

### 6. Submit Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Create a pull request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/plots if applicable
   - Test results
